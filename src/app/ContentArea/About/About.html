About Me
A quiet rebel
I grew up with three siblings – the children of parents who emigrated to the UK in the 50’s
and 60’s. I remember sometimes feeling different and “other” from my friends because of
my ethnicity; I never felt that I fitted in.
Sharing this sense of alienation with my siblings, we grew up very close. Bonded by our
“otherness,” we had fun together. But when I was 13 my brother committed suicide, and we
were left devastated. Shortly after that my parents divorced. Everything I thought I could
count on had evaporated.
These two experiences made me a passionate believer in the importance of good mental
health, and a fierce defender of those who don’t fit neat societal norms.
Living the life unexpected
By the time I reached my early 40s I had become one of a growing band of single, childless
women. I had created a good corporate career in Pharmacy, working on therapies to help
people with rare diseases, but I had no life other than my career and I realised that my hope
of meeting someone special, settle down and have a family, was not going to happen. I tried
fertility treatment on my own but, when I realised that my only option was to go abroad and
use donor eggs, I decided to draw the curtains on my dream.
I was an emotional wreck. I had lost interest in everything I used to enjoy and had no
motivation to do anything. I found it difficult to picture how my life would look moving
forward, or to imagine a different future. During these dark days I found an organisation
called Gateway Women, which provides support to women childless by circumstance, and I
joined a year-long mentorship program with the founder, Jody Day.
Rediscovering my love of coaching and mentoring
This experience helped me recover emotionally and when I was strong enough, I found an
empathetic coach to help me create a new plan. Working with her, I was reminded of the
joy I had always experienced at work when I coached and mentored my team. I decided to
enrol on a Masters in Coaching and Mentoring. I wanted to do for other childless women
what my coach and Gateway Women had done for me – help them regain their confidence
and motivation and find their path forward.
Yoga for grief

I discovered yoga 14 years ago and immediately fell in love with the way yoga connects
body and mind. Wanting to pass these benefits on to others, I trained as a yoga teacher with
the British Wheel of Yoga. When I was coming to terms with childlessness, I took further
training in Therapeutic Yoga, and Yin Yoga. The yoga and meditation practice I created to
help me through the physical and emotional consequences of my grief became the
foundation of my rejuvenating retreats for women without children, and my private yoga
classes.
It would be my great privilege and pleasure to use these experiences and skills to walk with
you, helping you not only cope with your childlessness, but create a joyous present and
future.
