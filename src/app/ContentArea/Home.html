        <li>Are you struggling to cope with childlessness?</li>
        <li>Do you question the point of a life without kids?</li>
        <li>Do you wonder if you will ever get over not having children?</li>
        <li>Do you feel lost, confused and alone because your dreams didn’t work out?</li>
      </ul>

      <br /><br />

      <h1 class="h2fix">I’ve been there </h1>
      Following my own experience of being childlessness not by choice, I’ve made it my purpose to transform other
      childless women’s experience of themselves as “not enough”.


      <h1 class="h2fix">I can help</h1>
      I offer coaching, yoga and meditation to help women recover from the grief of childlessness and rediscover their
      joy and purpose in life.


      <h1 class="h2fix">Together we can create you a joyous present and future</h1>
      I want all childless women, living the life unexpected, to see themselves as courageous and unlimited, with the
      freedom to create a joyous present and future.


      <h1 class="h2fix">How to cope with being childless not by choice</h1>
      Working as a yoga teacher, meditation teacher and life coach, I create effective strategies for both your body and
      soul – including pranayama (breath work), self-compassion and self-care – to help you cope with being childless
      not by choice.

      You will not only learn to cope with your grief, you will regain your confidence and motivation, and find your
      path forward, enabling you to live the life unexpected with optimism and joy.


      <h1 class="h2fix">One to one online and real-world classes, and groups</h1>
      I offer one to one online coaching including online yoga classes and online meditation classes, private yoga
      classes at home in Oxford, and nurturing weekend yoga retreats at a beautiful country house, just 10 miles south
      of Oxford.
