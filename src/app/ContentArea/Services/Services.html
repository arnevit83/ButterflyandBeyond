Weekend yoga retreat for childless women
This weekend yoga retreat offers a safe space for childless women to come together to
recover from the grief of childlessness and rediscover a sense of joy and purpose.
Taught entirely by childless women, and in the company of other childless women, you will
be nurtured body and soul in the beautiful setting of The Abbey, Sutton Courtenay,
Oxfordshire.
The weekend of healing and rejuvenation includes:
 Four gentle yoga classes with me – combining pranayama (breathwork), relaxation
and meditation.
 Delicious vegetarian food and a talk on nutrition and self-care.
 An inspiring workshop with a Gateway Women facilitator, personally trained by
founder Jody Day.
Single rooms from £345. Twins from £345.
